"""The N-round evolve loop split out of :mod:`zicato.orchestrator`.

:func:`evolve_n_rounds` calls :func:`zicato.orchestrator.evolve_once` up to
``rounds`` times, with the four loop circuit-breakers modelled as a small
:class:`StopPolicy` set:

* :class:`ConsecutiveRejectionPolicy` — stop after N rejected rounds in a row;
* :class:`DegenerateHealthPolicy` — stop after N consecutive CRITICAL
  loop-health findings;
* :class:`WallClockBudgetPolicy` — the total wall-clock ceiling, enforced
  both between rounds and (via :func:`asyncio.wait_for`) within a round.

The policies are pure bookkeeping over the existing counters/thresholds;
the loop drives them in the unchanged order and emits the unchanged log
lines and symbolic stop-reason strings. This is a behaviour-preserving
move — :func:`evolve_n_rounds` keeps its exact signature and is re-exported
from :mod:`zicato.orchestrator`.

Orchestrator-resident collaborators (``evolve_once``,
``ensure_epoch_for_contract``, ``_resolve_or_launch_harmonograf``,
``block_while_paused`` and the rest) are resolved through the
:mod:`zicato.orchestrator` module object at call time, exactly reproducing
the module-global late binding the in-orchestrator loop relied on — so the
test suite's monkeypatches of those names on the orchestrator module keep
working.

    row — that's a strong signal the proposer is stuck and the
    operator probably wants to inspect the proposer brief / patterns
    before spending more LLM calls. A successful promotion resets the
    consecutive-rejection counter.

    A second circuit breaker watches loop *health*: when
    ``stop_on_degenerate_health`` is true (the default), the loop stops
    early once :data:`_DEGENERATE_HEALTH_STOP_THRESHOLD` consecutive
    rounds report a CRITICAL loop-health finding (e.g. degenerate
    scoring — the tournament can no longer tell a real improvement from
    noise). Same spirit as the consecutive-rejection breaker: there is
    no point spending more LLM calls on a loop that is producing no
    usable signal. A round whose health is not CRITICAL resets the
    counter. Pass ``stop_on_degenerate_health=False`` to opt out and run
    every requested round regardless of health.

    A third early-exit is the **total wall-clock budget**: when
    ``max_wall_clock_seconds`` is set (``None``, the default, leaves the
    loop unbounded — the historical behaviour), the orchestrator records
    a monotonic start time and enforces the ceiling two ways:

    * **Between rounds** — before starting round N+1, if the elapsed
      time has already reached the budget, the loop stops cleanly with
      a logged message and returns the outcomes gathered so far. This
      mirrors the consecutive-reject breaker's shape exactly.
    * **Within a round** — each round's work is wrapped in
      :func:`asyncio.wait_for` with a timeout equal to the *remaining*
      budget, so a single long round cannot blow the total. A round
      that would exceed the ceiling is cancelled; it is recorded as an
      aborted round (a synthetic :class:`EvolveRoundOutcome` carrying a
      ``"wall_clock_budget"`` rejection reason) and the loop stops.

    The total budget is enforced *in addition to* — not instead of —
    each board entry's own ``wall_clock_budget_seconds``; both apply.
    Note the within-round cancellation is a Layer-1 ``asyncio.wait_for``
    guard (see ``docs/design/ROBUSTNESS.md``): it only pre-empts
    *cooperative* async work. A round wedged in a blocking call or a
    CPU-bound loop is not hard-killed here — that requires the
    subprocess-worker layer (L3). This is the same contract the
    per-entry budget relies on.

    Contract-hash auto-epoching runs ONCE, before the round loop: when
    ``epoch_id`` is ``None`` and ``auto_epoch`` is true, the orchestrator
    resolves (and, if the contract drifted, auto-rolls) the epoch via
    :func:`ensure_epoch_for_contract`. The resolved id is then pinned
    for every round of this invocation so the loop never re-rolls
    mid-flight. When ``epoch_id`` is passed explicitly, auto-rolling is
    skipped entirely — an explicit target always wins.

    The list of :class:`EvolveRoundOutcome` returned has one entry per
    round attempted (which may be fewer than ``rounds`` if any
    early-stop fired).

    ``stop_reason_out`` is an optional caller-supplied list the function
    appends a single symbolic terminal-reason string to before
    returning, so a caller (the CLI) can render a summary that
    distinguishes the terminal states without re-deriving them from the
    outcomes. One of: ``"completed"`` (all rounds ran),
    ``"consecutive_rejections"``, ``"degenerate_health"``,
    ``"wall_clock_budget_between_rounds"`` (the total budget was already
    spent before the next round started), or
    ``"wall_clock_budget_mid_round"`` (a round was cancelled because
    finishing it would overrun the total budget). Callers that do not
    pass the list see no behavioural change.
