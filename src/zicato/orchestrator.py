"""End-to-end evolve loop: one round, then N rounds.

The orchestrator is the integration point that ties together every
other zicato subsystem: it loads the workspace and the current epoch,
enumerates mutations and detects loss patterns, calls the proposer,
applies the resulting patches into a fresh snapshot, validates the
snapshot, runs the tournament, and persists the experiment with its
outcome. The CLI's ``zicato evolve`` command is a thin shell over
:func:`evolve_once` / :func:`evolve_n_rounds`.

Module imports are kept lightweight at top-level; heavier siblings
(:mod:`zicato.tournament.runner`, :mod:`zicato.mutation.applier`,
:mod:`zicato.proposer.proposer`, :mod:`zicato.patterns.detectors`)
are imported inside the body of each helper. This keeps ``zicato
--help`` fast even on a workspace whose runtime extras (goldfive,
google-adk) are not installed.

Two public entry points:

* :func:`evolve_once` — one round. Returns the
  :class:`EvolveRoundOutcome` describing what happened.
* :func:`evolve_n_rounds` — call ``evolve_once`` up to ``rounds``
  times. Bails out early after a configurable number of consecutive
  rejections (default 3) — that's a sign the proposer is stuck and
  the operator wants to look before spending more LLM calls.

    ------
    parent_generation_id:
        Lineage head this round challenged.
    proposed_generation_id:
        Id assigned to the child generation the proposer produced.
    tournament_decision:
        ``"promoted"`` or ``"rejected"``. ``"deferred"`` is mapped to
        ``"rejected"`` for the orchestrator's bookkeeping — the
        evolve loop only advances on promotions.
        :data:`DEFERRED_INFRA_DECISION` (``"deferred_infra"``) is the ONE
        additional value: the endpoint-outage circuit tripped, nothing
        was journaled (the experiment persists un-outcomed for the
        crash-resume reconciliation), and the loop backs off before the
        next round.
    rejection_reason:
        Symbolic / human-readable string when the round did not
        promote. Empty string on a successful promotion.
    parent_scalar:
        Parent generation's scalar score (drift + pass terms weighted).
    child_scalar:
        Child generation's scalar score.
    delta_scalar:
        ``child_scalar - parent_scalar``. Negative = improvement.
    health_summary:
        One-line summary of the round's loop-health assessment (see
        :func:`zicato.health.diagnostics.assess_loop_health`). Empty
        string when the health sibling is unavailable or the assessment
        could not be run — the round's outcome is unaffected either way.
    health_critical:
        ``True`` when the round's loop-health assessment surfaced at
        least one CRITICAL finding (e.g. degenerate scoring producing no
        signal). ``False`` otherwise, including when no assessment ran.
    pareto_record:
        The challenger of this round, placed on the multi-objective axes.
        See :mod:`zicato.tournament.pareto`. The value is ``None`` by
        default, and on every round while Pareto recording is off. The
        outcome carries this record because the frontier covers many
        rounds and ``evolve_once`` runs one round.
        :func:`zicato.evolve.loop.evolve_n_rounds` owns the ledger and
        adds the record of each round to it. The record is
        observational. No caller reads it back into a decision.

    ``resume_plan`` — when supplied by :func:`evolve_n_rounds` for the
    FIRST round of a resumed invocation — carries the conservative
    crash-resume decision (``runtime/resume.py``). When it
    ``resumes_in_place`` for the generation this round would mint, the
    propose + apply step is skipped and the persisted
    ``experiment.json`` + patches are reused: the snapshot is re-derived
    from those same patches (idempotent) and the tournament cache-HITs
    every board unit that already has a ``loss.json`` on disk, so only
    the entries that did not finish are re-run. ``None`` (the default, and
    every round after the first) is byte-identical to a cold start.

    ``beater`` — when supplied by :func:`evolve_n_rounds` — receives a
    :meth:`HeartbeatBeater.update` call at every phase transition
    (proposing / applying / tournament / done) stamped with the real
    ``epoch_id``, the generation id being worked on, and the
    ``round_index``, so the dashboard header reflects live progress.
    When ``None`` (a standalone ``evolve_once`` call) the heartbeat
    plumbing is simply skipped. ``round_index`` / ``total_rounds`` are
    also threaded into :func:`run_tournament` so the published
    tournament state can render "round N of M".

    Steps:

    1. Load the workspace config and the current epoch (board, proposer
       brief, scoring, adapter via the workspace's adapter factory).
    2. Resolve the current promoted generation as the parent.
    3. Re-enumerate mutation points against the parent's snapshot.
    4. Detect cross-run patterns over the parent's loss profiles.
    5. Render a short loss summary for the proposer.
    6. Call :func:`zicato.proposer.proposer.propose_experiment` with
       the auxiliary callable.
    7. Cross-check every patch's ``mutation_id`` against the
       re-enumerated mutation manifest.
    8. Apply the patches into a fresh
       ``generations/{new_gen}/snapshot/`` via the mutation applier.
    9. Validate the new snapshot via the mutation validator.
    10. Run the tournament (full or fast mode).
    11. Persist ``experiment.json`` + ``patches/{id}.json`` with the
        outcome populated.
    12. On promotion: update lineage and bump the current_epoch's
        promoted-head marker (a per-epoch ``current_generation`` file).
    13. Append a journal entry for the experiment.

    Returns
    -------
    EvolveRoundOutcome
        Always returned (one round, one outcome). Exceptions only
        propagate for unrecoverable errors (e.g. the proposer raises
        :class:`ProposerError` after exhausting retries; the validator
        rejects the new snapshot; the patch applier hits a stale
        mutation manifest).

    The function scores the TRAIN slice only, and it resolves that slice with
    the same :func:`zicato.board.split.split_board` call that the gate uses.
    Both sides of a duel run every board entry, and
    :attr:`TournamentResult.per_entry_losses` holds all of them. The split
    happens later, when the gate adds the scores up. This function must apply
    the same filter, for two reasons.

    First, the holdout slice is confirmation-only, and the proposer must never
    see it. A frontier built on the full board would carry holdout results,
    and a later step of this work shows the frontier to the proposer. That
    would defeat the split.

    Second, :attr:`Candidate.scalar` comes from the gate, which measures the
    train slice. Axes from the full board and a scalar from the train slice
    would describe different entry sets, and the log line prints them
    together.

    A board too small to split has no holdout, so the train slice is the whole
    board and this filter changes nothing.

    The function returns ``None`` if there is nothing to record. This occurs
    in two cases. First, recording is off, which is the shipped state. The
    early return then keeps a normal round free of extra work. Second, the
    duel gave no paired losses for each entry.

    The wide ``except`` clause is deliberate. The frontier is observational,
    and no later step reads it. No fault here is worth the loss of a round
    that is complete and already in the journal. The function logs the fault
    and returns ``None``.

    DEFAULT-ON (issue #84): unless the runtime opts out

    the achievable-signal pre-flight is measured once at evolve start — the
    A/A noise floor AND the champion-vs-degraded-copy signal — and its
    verdict persisted onto the epoch record. Idempotent: a later round (or a
    resume) short-circuits on the persisted record and re-reports its verdict
    without re-measuring. Best-effort by contract — a measurement failure
    never aborts the round.

    The number of A/A draws K is taken from the legacy ``config.json``
    ``"contract_preflight": K`` key when present (K >= 2), else defaults to
    :data:`~zicato.tournament.calibration.DEFAULT_CALIBRATION_RUNS`.

    when either the signal verdict or the ``promote_margin`` window refuses,
    else the signal verdict verbatim) when one is available (freshly measured

    verdict. ``"inert"`` is never a refusal — it says the probe, not the

    manual surface.

    One failure escapes the best-effort contract: a
    :class:`~zicato.epoch.preflight.PreflightConfigError` (an unknown pinned
    mutation id, a probe ceiling wider than the reserved replicate block)
    under ``gate_mode == "refuse"`` raises
    :class:`~zicato.epoch.preflight.PreflightRefusedError` from here. "An
